        <h1 style="text-align:left; font: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 25px;"><strong>BEST to resume bus ops from Monday; Covid tally is 82,968</strong></h1>
        <p>Mumbai : The state on Saturday reported 2,739 new Covid-19 cases and 120 more deaths, taking the tally and toll to 82,968 and 2,969 respectively, as the government moved towards easing curbs in a graded manner, which includes BEST resuming bus operations, albeit with restrictions, in the city from Monday — around three months after it was shut owing to the pandemic. The state expects the coronavirus curve to start flattening within the next 10 days.</p>
        <p>Tope announced on Saturday that the state government will procure 10,000 vials of Remdesivir injection. “The injection proved effective against SARS infection and is expected to be beneficial for coronavirus too as suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO). We have decided to purchase 10,000 vials of the injection from the Corporate Social Responsibility fund of corporate houses,” he said.</p>

      	 <p>It took nearly four months for the death toll from the respiratory illness to reach the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths. As the virus spread from China – where it first originated in December 2019 – to find a strong foothold in Europe, the number of fatalities doubled to 200,000 in another 15 days.</p>
      	 <p>Although European countries have begun to reopen businesses and industries, Latin America, particularly Brazil, has emerged as the latest epicentre of the viral disease, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
      	 <p>In the United States– the hardest-hit country with 1.97 million cases and 111,658 deaths -- the numbers have continued to mount even as the rate of the infection appears to be slowing down.</p>

     	    <p>At 246,472 cases, India on Saturday overtook Italy to become the country with the sixth-highest number of Covid-19 infections. However, with a death toll of 6,873 from the disease and a fatality rate of 2.8% till Saturday, it is significantly lower than the case fatality rate of other hard-hit nations such as the US (5.6%), UK (14.2%) and Italy (14.4%). Experts say the number of deaths from the pandemic is a more accurate representation of the virus’ prevalence in a region instead of the number of infections, as a large percentage of Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic and are never officially reported.</p>
